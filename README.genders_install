Setting up your system to use whatsup with the genders masterlist
mechanism is quite simple.

1)

To compile, build, and install (generically speaking) run:

> ./bootstrap
> ./configure --with-genders
> make
> make install

2)

Download and install genders and create a genders database in
/etc/genders.  This database should list every node in your cluster.

3)

You're done!  Begin using whatsup(1) to your heart's content.
