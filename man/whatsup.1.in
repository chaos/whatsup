.TH Whatsup 1 "August 2003" "LLNL" "Whatsup"
.SH NAME
whatsup \- list up and/or down nodes in a cluster
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whatsup
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fINODES\fR]...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B whatsup
lists which nodes are currently up or down in a cluster.  It
determines which nodes are up or down based on information gathered
from ganglia.

.B whatsup
will check on the status of every node in the cluster unless specific
nodes are listed at the command line.  The nodes can be listed in
hostlist format, comma separated lists, or space separated lists.  See
the section below on HOST RANGES for instructions on how to list hosts
in hostlist format.  The hostnames listed must be the shortened names
of hostnames.  What information is listed and how it is listed is
dependent on the options listed below.

.B whatsup 
is configured to work on non-deaf ganglia nodes or nodes in which a
nodeupdown configuration file points to a non-deaf ganglia server.
Generally speaking, non-deaf ganglia servers are only executed on
management nodes, not login or compute nodes.  In order to execute
.B whatsup
on a deaf ganglia node, use the --hostname ('o') or --ip ('i') options
to force
.B whatsup
to contact a management node's ganglia server.

.SH "HOST RANGES"
As noted in sections above,
.B whatsup
accepts ranges of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...],
where n < m and l < k, etc., as an alternative to explicit lists of
hosts.  This form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does
not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range:
foo19.

This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
or by the range foo[1,9].

Some examples of range usage follow:

List all nodes among foo01,foo02,...,foo05 that are up and down 
    whatsup foo[01-05]

List all nodes among foo7,foo9,foo10 that are up and down
    whatsup foo[7,9-10]

As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ('['
and ']') for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the above two examples should be executed as:

    whatsup "foo[01-05]"
    whatsup "foo[7,9-10]"
