.TH Whatsup 1 "August 2003" "LLNL" "Whatsup"
.SH NAME
whatsup \- list up and/or down nodes in a cluster
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whatsup
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fINODES\fR]...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B whatsup
lists which nodes are currently up or down in a cluster.  It
determines which nodes are up or down based on information provided
by the 
.B nodeupdown(3)
library.

.B whatsup
will check on the status of every node in the cluster unless specific
nodes are listed at the command line.  If the first node listed is
"-", nodes will be read in from standard input.  The nodes can be
listed in hostrange format, comma separated lists, or space separated
lists.  See the section below on HOST RANGES for instructions on how
to list hosts in hostrange format.  The hostnames listed must be the
shortened names of hostnames.

The exit value of 
.B whatsup
depends on the options performed on the command line.  If the default
--updown option is used, the exit value will be 0 if the command
succeeds without error.  If the --up option is used and no nodes are
specified via the command line or standard input, the exit value will
be 0 if all cluster nodes are up.  If nodes are specified via the
command line or standard input, the exit value wil be 0 if all the
specified nodes are up.  The behavior is similar for the --down
option.

output.

stdout.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-log-poll

.if @MANPAGE_GENDERSLLNL@ \{
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-altnames
List nodes by alternate names (default=off).  Only available if the
gendersllnl whatsup module has been installed.
\}
.LP
.SH HOST RANGES
As noted in sections above,
.B whatsup
accepts ranges of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...],
where n < m and l < k, etc., as an alternative to explicit lists of
hosts.  This form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does
not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range:
foo19.

This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
or by the range foo[1,9].

Some examples of range usage follow:

List all nodes among foo01,foo02,...,foo05 that are up and down 
    whatsup foo[01-05]

List all nodes among foo7,foo9,foo10 that are up and down
    whatsup foo[7,9-10]

As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ('['
and ']') for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the above two examples should be executed as:

    whatsup "foo[01-05]"
    whatsup "foo[7,9-10]"
