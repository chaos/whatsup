.SH NAME
nodeupdown_hostsfile.conf \- specify all hosts in the cluster
.SH DESCRIPTION

When dealing with up and down nodes in a cluster, ganglia report nodes
as down only if it had previous communication with the node.
Therefore, if a node has never sent a ganglia message, ganglia has no
means of reporting the node as down.

Therefore, to determine all of the down nodes in a cluster, a "master
list" of nodes is required by whatsup and the nodeupdown library.  The
file lists the nodes in the cluster, one node per line.  The nodes
should be the shortened hostname versions of the nodes (typically
obtained using hostname -s).  Comments can be placed in the file by
beginning a line with the pound ('#') symbol.

An example configuration file is shown below.

# HP nodes

# Sun Nodes
