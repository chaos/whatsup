1) Read INSTALL.

2) Ganglia only has knowledge about cluster nodes in which it has
   has previous communication with.  Therefore, if a node has never
   sent a ganglia message (for example, 1 node was out for servicing when
   the entire cluster was rebooted), ganglia will not be able to report
   this node as down.
   
   In order to determine all of the down nodes in a cluster,
   whatsup and the nodeupdown library require a "master list" of
   nodes in the cluster.  "master list" mechanisms can be compiled
   into whatsup by specifying a master list option with ./configure.

   Currently, the following "master list" mechanisms are implemented
   in whatsup.

   * genders - uses a genders database and the genders library as a 
               master list of all nodes in the cluster. In addition,
	       using the gendersllnl library, node names and alternate
	       node names are resolved and turned into the same.	
   
   * master list file - a file that lists the shortened hostname of
	                every node in teh cluster, one per line.
                        Comments can be placed in the file using a
                        pound sign ('#') at the beginning of a line.

   * none - whatsup and nodeupdown will only use ganglia data to
            determine the difference between up nodes, down nodes, and
            nodes that are not part of the cluster.

   Other mechanisms may be implemented in the future.
