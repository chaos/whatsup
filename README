Whatsup is cluster node up/down detection utility. 

The whatsup package includes:

* libnodeupdown
  - A C library to determine up or down nodes in a cluster.  See
    libnodeupdown(3)

* Libnodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that takes advantage
    of the already available C library.  Perl extensions is limited
    and provides an unorthodox Perl API.  It is therefore recommended
    most users use Nodeupdown.pm.  See Libnodeupdown(3).

* Nodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libnodeupdown.pm, hiding away
    the ugliness of Libnodeupdown.pm.  See Nodeupdown(3).

* whatsup
  - A command that outputs the up and down nodes in a cluster. See
    whatsup(1).

The nodeupdown library works in conjunction with one of several
possible backend tools and a cluster database of nodes.

The currently available backend tools are:

Ganglia: See http://ganglia.sourceforge.net

Cerebro: See URL to be determined.

The currently clusterlist database tools are:

Gendersllnl - For the most part, specifically used by Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.

Genders - Uses a genders database and the genders library to determine
all nodes in the cluster.

Hostsfile - Uses a file that lists the hostname of every node in the
cluster on a separate line.

The nodeupdown library may also load a configuration module to make
cluster configuration easier.  The currently available clusterlist
database tools are:

Gendersllnl - For the most part, specifically used by Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.

For whatsup to work, atleast one backend module must be installed.  If
more than one is installed, the first one discovered will be used.

More information about writing backend, clusterlist, and configuration
modules, see the nodeupdown_module manpage.
