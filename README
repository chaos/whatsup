Whatsup is cluster node up/down detection utility. 

The whatsup package includes:

* libnodeupdown
  - A C library to determine up or down nodes in a cluster.  See
    libnodeupdown(3)

* Libnodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that takes advantage
    of the already available C library.  Perl extensions is limited
    and provides an unorthodox Perl API.  It is therefore recommended
    most users use Nodeupdown.pm.  See Libnodeupdown(3).

* Nodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libnodeupdown.pm, hiding away
    the ugliness of Libnodeupdown.pm.  See Nodeupdown(3).

* whatsup
  - A command that outputs the up and down nodes in a cluster. See
    whatsup(1).

The nodeupdown library works in conjunction with one of several
possible backend tools and a cluster database of nodes.

The currently available backend tools are:

Pingd: A simple daemon that regularly pings cluster nodes.

Ganglia: See http://ganglia.sourceforge.net

Cerebro: See http://cerebro.sourceforge.net

The Pingd daemon is distributed along with whatsup as a subpackage.

The current clusterlist database tools are:

Genders - Uses a genders database and the genders library to determine
all nodes in the cluster.

Hostsfile - Uses a file that lists the hostname of every node in the
cluster on a separate line.

The nodeupdown library may also load a configuration module to make
cluster configuration easier.  

For whatsup to work, you must have one of the backend tools already
installed and configured on your system.  Atleast one backend module
for the libnodeupdown library must also be installed.  If more than
one module is installed, the first one discovered will be used.

A clusterlist does not need to be installed for whatsup to work,
however it would be beneficial to use atleast one.

More information about writing backend, clusterlist, and configuration
modules, see the nodeupdown_module manpage.
