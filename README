Whatsup is cluster node up/down detection utility. 

The whatsup package includes:

* libnodeupdown
  - A C library to determine up or down nodes in a cluster.  See
    libnodeupdown(3)

* Libnodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that takes advantage
    of the already available C library.  Perl extensions is limited
    and provides an unorthodox Perl API.  It is therefore recommended
    most users use Nodeupdown.pm.  See Libnodeupdown(3).

* Nodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libnodeupdown.pm, hiding away
    the ugliness of Libnodeupdown.pm.  See Nodeupdown(3).

* whatsup
  - A command that outputs the up and down nodes in a cluster. See
    whatsup(1).

The nodeupdown library works in conjunction with one of several
possible backend tools and a cluster database of nodes.  The backend tool
and clusterlist are configurable through the nodeupdown configuration
file.  See nodeupdown.conf(5) for more information. 

The currently available backend tools are:

Ganglia: See http://ganglia.sourceforge.net

The currently clusterlist database tools are:

Gendersllnl - For the most part, specifically used by Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.

Genders - Uses a genders database and the genders library to determine
all nodes in the cluster.

Hostsfile: Uses a file that lists the hostname of every node in the
cluster.

None: No database will be used.

Other backend and clusterlist modules may be implemented in the
future.  If you are interested in seeing some new mechanism
implemented, feel free to e-mail me and I'll see what I can do.
