1) Read INSTALL.

2) Ganglia only has knowledge about cluster nodes in which it has
   has previous communication with.  Therefore, if a node has never
   sent a ganglia message (for example, 1 node was out for servicing when
   the entire cluster was rebooted), ganglia will not be able to report
   this node as down.
   
   In order to determine all of the down nodes in a cluster,
   whatsup and the nodeupdown library require a "master list" of
   nodes in the cluster.  "master list" mechanisms can be compiled
   into whatsup by specifying a master list options with ./configure.

   Currently, the following "master list" mechanisms are implemented
   in whatsup.
   - genders

   Other mechanisms may be implemented in the future.

   If no "master list" mechanism is specified, whatsup will use only
   ganglia data to determine the difference between up and down nodes.
