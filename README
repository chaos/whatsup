Description:
------------

Whatsup is cluster node up/down detection utility. 

The whatsup package includes:

* libnodeupdown
  - A C library to determine up or down nodes in a cluster.  See
    libnodeupdown(3)

* Libnodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that takes advantage
    of the already available C library.  Perl extensions is limited
    and provides an unorthodox Perl API.  It is therefore recommended
    most users use Nodeupdown.pm.  See Libnodeupdown(3).

* Nodeupdown.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libnodeupdown.pm, hiding away
    the ugliness of Libnodeupdown.pm.  See Nodeupdown(3).

* whatsup
  - A command that outputs the up and down nodes in a cluster. See
    whatsup(1).

Backend Tools:
--------------

The nodeupdown library works in conjunction with one of several
possible backend tools.

The currently available backend tools are:

Pingd: A simple daemon that regularly pings cluster nodes.

Ganglia: See http://ganglia.sourceforge.net

Cerebro: See http://cerebro.sourceforge.net

The Pingd daemon is distributed along with whatsup as a subpackage.

Clusterlist Definitions:
------------------------

The nodeupdown library can also work in conjunction with several
cluster databases.

Genders - Uses a genders database and the genders library to determine
all nodes in the cluster.

Hostsfile - Uses a file that lists the hostname of every node in the
cluster on a separate line.

Install:
--------

For whatsup to work, you must install and configuration one of the
backend tools for your system.  The appropriate backend module for the
libnodeupdown library must then be installed.  If more than one module
is installed, the first one discovered will be used.

A clusterlist module and clusterlist database does not need to be
installed for whatsup to work, however it would be beneficial to
define one.
