Whatsup is cluster node up/down detection utility.  Nodes can be
detected as up or down through a number of backend mechanisms,
including Ganglia, Cerebro, or the included Pingd daemon.  Several
file formats can be used to specify the nodes within your cluster.  A
C and Perl library are also available to determine up and down nodes.
