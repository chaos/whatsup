This file describes changes in recent versions of whatsup. It
primarily documents those changes that are of interest to users
and admins.

Changes in whatsup-1.3-1
===========================
- Added nodeupdown_up_count and nodeupdown_down_count API functions.
- Added Nodeupdown and Libnodeupdown perl libraries.
- Added --count option to whatsup
- Removed --ip option from whatsup
- Default whatsup output also includes output of node counts. 
- Whatsup and nodeupdown now compile and execute independently of 
  libganglia. 
- The nodeupdown.conf(5) file now allows specification of multiple
  hostnames instead of just one.
- Modified nodeupdown_load_data(3) API function to be far more
  generic and not based on libganglia.  This *will* break older code.
- To be consistent with changes to the API, nodeupdown.conf(5) no
  longer accepts the gmond_ip configuration option.
- Although the default is still genders, whatsup can now be compiled
  with different mechanisms for determining all of the nodes in a
  cluster.  See README file for details.
